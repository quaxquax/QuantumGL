How to build QuantumGL:

*** Mac OS X version:
Open QuantumGL.pbproj in Xcode, and just build it :-).
If you modify the parser or lexer (quantum.y or quantum.l),
fire up a Terminal and run 'make parser'.

Required Libraries: Nothing that isn't included with Mac OS X.

*** Windows version:
The included Makefile is written for a mingw32 cross compiler running on Mac OS X or Linux; it's probably easier to just download Mingw32 for Windows from www.mingw.org and modify the Makefile (just remove the mingw32- prefixes from the commands).
Once you've set up your compiler, issue the command:

make -f Makefile.mingw

Libraries you need to install: libz libpng

*** GLUT/X11-based minimal frontend on any UNIX platform:

make -f Makefile.x11

Required Libraries: X11 with OpenGL support, glut (or freeglut).
